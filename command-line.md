# Testing git commands: stage, commit etc.

## Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?

Here is my most sensible answer ever

## List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do.

1. `ls` - lists all the files in a dir
2. `pwd` - or "Print working directory" - shows what dir you are in
3. `cd` - change directory
